Image Compression Using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)

Overview

This MATLAB script compresses a grayscale image using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). The process involves:

1. Wavelet Decomposition: Splitting the image into different frequency subbands.


2. Thresholding: Removing insignificant coefficients to reduce data.


3. Quantization: Reducing precision to save space.


4. Run-Length Encoding (RLE): Compressing repeated values.
